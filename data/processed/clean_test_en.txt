international travel magazines repeatedly praised vietnam's food in 2022, cementing the country’s growing status as a global culinary destination.
in january, cnn ranked pho bo among the world’s finest soups, alongside china’s lanzhou noodles and thailand’s tom yum goong.
pho bo remains the nation’s favorite breakfast; diners choose raw beef, a raw‑and‑cooked mix, brisket, or tendon, and a bowl in hanoi or ho chi minh city typically costs vnd30,000-80,000 (about $1.32-3.40).
in may, cnn also placed banh mi on its list of the 23 best sandwiches, noting its popularity far beyond vietnam.
the vietnamese sandwich blends cold cuts with herbs like coriander and cucumber, pickled carrots and daikon, and pate, finished with french‑style condiments such as mayonnaise.
common toppings include cha lua, a fried egg, grilled pork, or meatballs; a fully loaded loaf usually sells for vnd15,000-50,000, and american traveler rita joe graybill called it a must‑try.
that same month, cnn highlighted banh cam-deep‑fried glutinous rice balls filled with mung bean paste-rolled in sesame; in the north, a similar treat, banh ran, is served with sugary syrup.
canada’s the travel named vietnam a country with a distinctive coffee culture; ca phe sua da (iced coffee with condensed milk) is brewed with dark roast coffee, poured over ice and milk at sidewalk stalls, and often costs only vnd10,000-15,000.
australian libby watkins raved about vietnamese coffee, saying local restaurants back home still cannot match the flavor.
in june, hong kong’s south china morning post introduced cha ruoi, a ragworm omelet popular in northern vietnam during late autumn and early winter, especially in hai duong, quang ninh, and hai phong.
ragworms are briefly put in hot water to remove tentacles, then mixed with minced pork, tangerine peel, herbs, and eggs before being fried to a crisp.
scmp also featured hoi an’s cao lau: thick noodles that deliver sweet, sour, salty, spicy, and bitter notes, garnished with bean sprouts and tra que herbs, plus slices of barbecue pork and crunchy fried pig skin.
in hanoi, scmp described bun ca as unmissable: a light broth from fish bones with tomatoes, wine vinegar, and dill, served with crunchy fried catfish or fishcakes and piles of herbs like coriander and basil.
phu quoc’s signature bun quay (stirred noodles) evolved from a central‑region recipe with only ground shrimp; island cooks add fish and squid, hand‑make rice noodles, stir a paste of shrimp, fish, and squid with onions and herbs, then pour on the noodle‑cooking broth before adding noodles last.
later in the year, tasteatlas selected vietnamese duck porridge among asia’s top duck dishes: steamed duck pieces in rice porridge served with fish sauce mixed with sliced chilies and minced ginger.
the porridge is commonly paired with shallots, carrots, ginger, green onions, coriander, black pepper, and duck blood pudding, plus a banana‑flower salad with vietnamese coriander, carrots, and red onions sprinkled with crushed peanuts.
a bowl of duck porridge typically costs vnd30,000-50,000 and is easy to find at street‑side beer stalls.
